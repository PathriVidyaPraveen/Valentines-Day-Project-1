        <h1>Will You Be Mine Forever? 💖</h1>
        <p>Oh my dear, I wanted to say this to you for a long time. But every time I tried to move
             forward and take a step ahead to tell this to you...my heart always skipped a beat. But I
              am not able to live my life like this in a state of dilemma and nervousness. On this
               special occasion, I wanted to confess my feelings for you. I am saying this from the
                bottom of my heart...❤️❤️💕</p>
        <p>The first time I had seen you... it is the second time I was born. That was the day I came to
             realize what makes me happy. Till that day, every day I have lived...I always used to have
              some kind of dissatisfaction in my heart. I felt that this is not the life I have wished
               for. When you entered into my life, I felt very special. Everyday I have spent with you
                remains in my life as a beautiful memory. The care and love I have received from you...
                ugghhh I can't describe it in words. I will promise you that whatever the situation is,
                 I will always stand with you. You are the most precious gift God has given me. I wanted
                 to live with you always... start my day by your side and end my day sleeping
                  in your lap... Will you be my queen? 👑</p>
